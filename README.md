# Targeted Adversarial Examples

TODO:
- [x] implement FGSM (Fast Gradient Sign Attack) and BIM (basic iterative method) - DONE, basically iterative FGSM
- [ ] add tests - make production ready
- [ ] add type hints
- [ ] add docstrings and comments
- [ ] rethink structure - my initial goal for this project was to build a real library; like a playground where users/newcomers would experiment with different adversarial attack methods
- [ ] create setup.cfg etc. and publish on PYpi - would be nice to be able to do "pip install adversarialplayground" and start experimenting with various implementations
- [ ] implement projected gradient descent method and think about adversarial examples for LLM/NLP domain
- [ ] update read me and add documentation
